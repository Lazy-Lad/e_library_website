# e_library_website
This is a group project of e-library for our college.
If you want to run all of the code on your local machine. Then you have to download XAMPP or any localhost software with Apache 
and mySql enabeled. 
since most of the page is in php format you must run this on server.
And if you do like Our work then feel free to comment and give some suggestion.
Happy coding.
